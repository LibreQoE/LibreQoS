# Bakery Integration Status

## Completed âœ…

1. **Python Bindings** - All 6 bakery functions are implemented in lqos_python:
   - `bakery_clear_prior_settings()`
   - `bakery_mq_setup()`
   - `bakery_add_structural_htb_class()`
   - `bakery_add_circuit_htb_class()`
   - `bakery_add_circuit_qdisc()`
   - `bakery_execute_tc_commands()`

2. **LibreQoS.py Integration** - All 5 integration points have bakery calls added:
   - clearPriorSettings() - Line 154
   - MQ Setup - Line 911
   - Structural HTB Classes - Lines 1000 & 1018 (download & upload)
   - Circuit HTB Classes - Lines 1068 & 1112 (download & upload)
   - Circuit Qdiscs - Lines 1102 & 1144 (download & upload)
   - Bulk TC Execution - Line 1215

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - `calculate_hash_for_bakery()` - Generates signed 64-bit hashes
   - Hex parsing for classMajor/classMinor values

4. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - `test_bakery_integration.py` - Main integration test
   - `debug_tc_differences.py` - Analyze TC output differences
   - `clean_tc_outputs.sh` - Clean up between tests

## Issues Found ðŸ”§

1. **Bakery Commands Not Executing**:
   - Python bindings return `True` but no `tc-rust.txt` file is created
   - Suggests lqosd may not have bakery command routing implemented
   - Need to verify lqosd has the bakery thread started and command routing

2. **Performance Concern**:
   - With individual bakery calls enabled, LibreQoS.py appears to hang
   - 736 TC commands would mean 736+ bus round-trips
   - Bulk execution via `bakery_execute_tc_commands()` is the better approach

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹

1. **Verify lqosd Integration**:
   - Check if lqosd starts the bakery thread
   - Verify BusRequest routing to bakery is implemented
   - Ensure bakery is configured with `WRITE_TC_TO_FILE = true`

2. **Optimize for Bulk Execution**:
   - Consider disabling individual bakery calls
   - Use only `bakery_execute_tc_commands()` for Phase 1
   - This matches Python's approach of writing all commands then executing with `tc -b`

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Once bakery routing is confirmed in lqosd:
     - Run integration test to compare outputs
     - Fix any formatting differences
     - Test with fractional speeds
     - Test with different network configurations

## Code Status

- Python integration is complete but commented out individual calls may need to be removed
- Rust bakery implementation is complete (from previous work)
- Python bindings are complete and functional
- Integration test suite is ready to use

The main blocker appears to be the lqosd-side integration of bakery command routing.
