# Bakery Integration Status Update

## Date: 2025-02-06

### Key Findings

1. **Bakery IS partially working!** 
   - When individual calls are enabled, the bakery writes to `/home/herbert/Rust/LibreQoS/libreqos/LibreQoS/src/rust/lqosd/tc-rust.txt`
   - The output file is in the lqosd directory, not the current working directory

2. **Issues Identified**:
   - Individual bakery calls cause LibreQoS.py to timeout (too many round-trips)
   - ExecuteTCCommands (bulk execution) returns True but doesn't create output
   - The bakery appends to tc-rust.txt instead of overwriting

3. **Differences Found**:
   - Python uses hex notation (0x1) while Rust uses decimal (1)
   - Output location differs (current dir vs lqosd dir)

### Recommendations

1. **For Phase 1 Testing**:
   - Temporarily enable individual calls to generate tc-rust.txt
   - Run with a small test dataset to avoid timeouts
   - Compare outputs after fixing the location issue

2. **For Production**:
   - Fix ExecuteTCCommands implementation in bakery
   - Use only bulk execution to avoid performance issues
   - Make bakery overwrite tc-rust.txt instead of appending

3. **Quick Fixes Needed**:
   - Update bakery to write to current directory or make path configurable
   - Implement ExecuteTCCommands handler in bakery
   - Match Python's hex notation for consistency

### Test Results

- **Individual calls**: Work but cause timeout with 736 commands
- **Bulk execution**: Returns True but doesn't execute
- **Output location**: `rust/lqosd/tc-rust.txt` instead of current directory

### Next Steps

1. Fix ExecuteTCCommands in the bakery implementation
2. Update output path to match Python's working directory
3. Convert decimal to hex notation in Rust output
4. Test with smaller dataset to verify exact match
