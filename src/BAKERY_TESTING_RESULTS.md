# Bakery Testing Results

## Test Date: 2025-02-06

### Summary
- Python bindings are working correctly (all functions return True)
- LibreQoS.py integration is complete with bakery calls at all 5 points
- However, bakery commands are not being executed or written to `tc-rust.txt`

### Test Results

1. **Individual Bakery Calls**: ❌ Cause timeout
   - With all bakery calls enabled, LibreQoS.py hangs
   - Likely due to 700+ individual bus round-trips

2. **Bulk Execution Only**: ✅ Completes successfully
   - LibreQoS.py runs in ~6 seconds with bulk-only approach
   - Generates 736 TC commands in `linux_tc.txt`
   - But `tc-rust.txt` is not created

3. **Diagnostics**:
   - All bakery functions return `True`
   - lqosd is running and responding to bus requests
   - No `tc-rust.txt` file is created despite `WRITE_TC_TO_FILE = true`

### Root Cause
The bakery commands are reaching lqosd (hence returning True) but are not being executed. This indicates one of:

1. **Bakery thread not started** - lqosd may not be starting the bakery thread
2. **Command routing not implemented** - BusRequest::Bakery* variants may not be routed to bakery
3. **Bakery not initialized properly** - The bakery may not be set up correctly in lqosd

### Recommendation
For Phase 1, we should:
1. Fix the lqosd bakery integration (start thread, route commands)
2. Use only bulk execution (`bakery_execute_tc_commands`) to avoid performance issues
3. Once working, compare `linux_tc.txt` with `tc-rust.txt` for exact match

### Files Generated
- `linux_tc.txt`: 736 TC commands (81KB)
- `tc-rust.txt`: Not generated ❌

### Next Steps
1. Check lqosd implementation:
   - Is `lqos_bakery::start_bakery()` called?
   - Are BusRequest::Bakery* variants handled?
   - Is the bakery Sender stored and used?

2. Once fixed, run integration test to compare outputs

3. Fix any formatting differences to achieve exact match
