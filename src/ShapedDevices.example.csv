# LibreQoS Shaped Devices Configuration Example
# 
# This file demonstrates the CSV format for defining shaped devices (circuits) in LibreQoS.
# As of LibreQoS v1.5+, fractional bandwidth rates are supported for more granular control.
#
# Rate Fields Support Decimal Values:
# - Download Min Mbps: Minimum download rate (≥ 0.1 Mbps) - supports decimals like 0.5, 2.5
# - Upload Min Mbps: Minimum upload rate (≥ 0.1 Mbps) - supports decimals like 0.5, 2.5  
# - Download Max Mbps: Maximum download rate (≥ 0.2 Mbps) - supports decimals like 10.5, 100.5
# - Upload Max Mbps: Maximum upload rate (≥ 0.2 Mbps) - supports decimals like 10.5, 100.5
#
# TC Command Generation:
# - Rates < 1 Mbps: Converted to kbit (e.g., 0.5 Mbps → 500kbit)
# - Rates 1-999 Mbps: Use mbit units (e.g., 2.5 Mbps → 2.5mbit)
# - Rates ≥ 1000 Mbps: Use gbit units (e.g., 1500.5 Mbps → 1.5gbit)
#
# Backward Compatibility: Existing integer rates continue to work unchanged.
#
# Per‑Circuit SQM Override (last column `sqm`):
# - Accepts: "cake", "fq_codel", "none" or directional form "down_sqm/up_sqm".
# - Directional form: left token applies to download, right to upload. Either side may be empty
#   to indicate no override for that direction (e.g., "cake/" or "/fq_codel").
# - Case is ignored on load; values are normalized to trimmed, lowercase.
# - "none" on a side disables the SQM qdisc for that direction.
# - When a side is unspecified (empty) or the entire field is empty, LibreQoS uses the global
#   default SQM for that side and still applies the fast‑queue threshold (fq_codel) per direction.
