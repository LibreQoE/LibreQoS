# Configure LibreQoS

## Main Configuration File
### /etc/lqos.conf

The LibreQoS configuration for each shaper box is stored in the file `/etc/lqos.conf`.

Edit the file to match your setup with

```shell
sudo nano /etc/lqos.conf
```

In the ```[bridge]``` section, change `to_internet` and `to_network` to match your network interfaces.
- `to_internet = "enp1s0f1"`
- `to_network = "enp1s0f2"`

Then, if using Bifrost/XDP set `use_xdp_bridge = true` under that same `[bridge]` section. If you're not sure whether you need this, we recommend to leave it as `false`.

- Set downlink_bandwidth_mbps and uplink_bandwidth_mbps to match the bandwidth in Mbps of your network's upstream / WAN internet connection. The same can be done for generated_pn_download_mbps and generated_pn_upload_mbps.
- to_internet would be the interface facing your edge router and the broader internet
- to_network would be the interface facing your core router (or bridged internal network if your network is bridged)

Note: If you find that traffic is not being shaped when it should, please make sure to swap the interface order and restart lqosd as well as lqos_scheduler with ```sudo systemctl restart lqosd lqos_scheduler```.

After changing any part of `/etc/lqos.conf` it is highly recommended to always restart lqosd, using `sudo systemctl restart lqosd`. This re-parses any new values in lqos.conf, making those new values accessible to both the Rust and Python sides of the code.

### Integrations

Learn more about [configuring integrations here](../TechnicalDocs/integrations.md).

## Network Hierarchy
### Network.json

Network.json allows ISP operators to define a Hierarchical Network Topology, or Flat Network Topology.

If you plan to use the built-in UISP or Splynx integrations, you do not need to create a network.json file quite yet.
If you plan to use the built-in UISP integration, it will create this automatically on its first run (assuming network.json is not already present).

If you will not be using an integration, you can manually define the network.json following the template file - network.example.json

```text
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Entire Network                                                        |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Parent Node A         | Parent Node B         | Parent Node C         |
+-----------------------+-------+-------+-------+-----------------------+
| Parent Node D | Sub 3 | Sub 4 | Sub 5 | Sub 6 | Sub 7 | Parent Node F |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| Sub 1 | Sub 2 |       |                       |       | Sub 8 | Sub 9 |
+-------+-------+-------+-----------------------+-------+-------+-------+
```

For networks with no Parent Nodes (no strictly defined Access Points or Sites) edit the network.json to use a Flat Network Topology with
```nano network.json```
setting the following file content:

```json
{}
```

#### CSV to JSON conversion helper

You can use

```shell
python3 csvToNetworkJSON.py
```

to convert manualNetwork.csv to a network.json file.
manualNetwork.csv can be copied from the template file, manualNetwork.template.csv

Note: The parent node name must match that used for clients in ShapedDevices.csv

## Circuits

LibreQoS shapes individual devices by their IP addresses, which are grouped into "circuits".

A circuit represents an ISP subscriber's internet service, which may have just one associated IP (the subscriber's router may be assigned a single /32 IPv4 for example) or it might have multiple IPs associated (maybe their router has a /29 assigned, or multiple /32s).

LibreQoS knows how to shape these devices, and what Node (AP, Site, etc) they are contained by, with the ShapedDevices.csv file.

### ShapedDevices.csv

The ShapedDevices.csv file correlates device IP addresses to Circuits (each internet subscriber's unique service).

Here is an example of an entry in the ShapedDevices.csv file:
| Circuit ID | Circuit Name | Device ID | Device Name | Parent Node | MAC | IPv4                      | IPv6                 | Download Min Mbps | Upload Min Mbps | Download Max Mbps | Upload Max Mbps | Comment |
|------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----|---------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|
| 10001      | Person Name  | 10001     | Device 1    | AP_A        |     | 100.64.0.2, 100.64.0.8/29 | fdd7:b724:0:100::/56 | 25                | 5               | 155               | 20              |         |

If you are using one of our CRM integrations, this file will be automatically generated. If you are not using an integration, you can manually edit the file using either the WebUI or by directly editing the ShapedDevices.csv file through the CLI.

#### Manual Editing by WebUI
Navigate to the LibreQoS WebUI (http://a.b.c.d:9123) and select Configuration > Shaped Devices.

#### Manual Editing by CLI

- Modify the ShapedDevices.csv file using your preferred spreadsheet editor (LibreOffice Calc, Excel, etc), following the template file - ShapedDevices.example.csv
- Circuit ID is required. Must be a string of some sort (int is fine, gets parsed as string). Must NOT include any number symbols (#). Every circuit needs a unique CircuitID - they cannot be reused. Here, circuit essentially means customer location. If a customer has multiple locations on different parts of your network, use a unique CircuitID for each of those locations.
- At least one IPv4 address or IPv6 address is required for each entry.
- The Access Point or Site name should be set in the Parent Node field. Parent Node can be left blank for flat networks.
- The ShapedDevices.csv file allows you to set minimum guaranteed, and maximum allowed bandwidth per subscriber.
- The minimum allowed plan rates for Circuits are 2Mbit. Bandwidth min and max should both be above that threshold.
- Recommendation: set the min bandwidth to something like 25/10 and max to 1.15X advertised plan rate by using bandwidthOverheadFactor = 1.15
  - This way, when an AP hits its ceiling, users have any remaining AP capacity fairly distributed between them.
  - Ensure a reasonable minimum bandwidth minimum for every subscriber, allowing them to utilize up to the maximum provided when AP utilization is below 100%.

Note regarding SLAs: For customers with SLA contracts that guarantee them a minimum bandwidth, set their plan rate as the minimum bandwidth. That way when an AP approaches its ceiling, SLA customers will always get that amount.

Once your configuration is complete. You're ready to run the application and start the [Deamons](./services-and-run.md)
