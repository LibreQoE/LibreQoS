LibreQoS is a Quality of Experience (QoE) Smart Queue Management (SQM) system designed for Internet Service Providers to optimize the flow of their network traffic and thus reduce bufferbloat, keep the network responsive, and improve the end-user experience.

Servers running LibreQoS can shape traffic for thousands of customers. On higher-end servers, LibreQoS is capable of shaping 50-80 Gbps of traffic.

## Long-Term Stats (LTS)

Long-Term Stats (LTS) is an analytics service built for LibreQoS that revolutionizes the way you track and analyze your network.
With flexible time window views ranging from 5 minutes to 1 month, LTS gives you comprehensive insights into your network's performance.
Built from the ground-up for performance and efficiency, LTS greatly outperforms our original InfluxDB plugin, and gives you rapidly rendered data to help you maximize your network performance.

We provide a free 30-day trial of LTS, after which the rate is $0.30 USD per shaped subscriber.
You can enroll in the 30-day free trial by [upgrading to the latest version of LibreQoS v1.4](https://libreqos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/Updates/update.html) and selecting "Start Stats Free Trial" in the top-right corner of the local LibreQoS WebUI.
