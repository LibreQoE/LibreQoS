LibreQoS is software used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and companies to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of end-users on their networks. 

LibreQoS works by monitoring network performance and reducing latency for interactive online applications. ISPs regularly report that trouble calls reduce substantially after deploying LibreQoS on networks.

For an ISP or other company to deploy LibreQoS – no changes are required for existing Routers, Switches or Access points: LibreQoS runs on a server that acts as a managed bridge sitting between the edge router and the core of the network. LibreQoS servers can shape traffic for tens of thousands of customers.

LibreQoS benefits network operation and planning by measuring metrics such as end-to-end TCP round trip time for each Subscriber, Access Point, and Site on a network – saving the relevant data for later analysis on the LibreQoS Long Term Stats (LTS) system.

LibreQoS code is Open Source. It improves Quality of Experience by implementing state of the art Flow Queueing (FQ) and Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithms. LibreQoS offers paid support packages and subscriptions to additional analysis service features available through [LTS](https://libreqos.io/lts/).
