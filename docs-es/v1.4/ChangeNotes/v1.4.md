# LibreQoS v1.3.1 to v1.4 Change Summary

Version 1.4 is a huge milestone. A whole new back-end, new GUI, 30%+ performance improvements, support for single-interface mode.

## Some Statistics

- **564** Commits since 1.3.1
- **28,399** Lines of Code
  - **10,142** lines of Rust
  - **5,448** lines of HTML & JavaScript
  - **3,126** lines of Python
  - **2,023** lines of C

## Peak Performance (So Far)

- Tested single-stream performance of just under 10 gbit/s on a 16-core Xeon Gold (single interface architecture, using 8 cores for each direction). The flow was shaped with Cake, and retained good (<10 ms RTT latency) performance.
- Tested 25 gbit/s total throughput on the same system. CPU was not saturated---we didn't have a bigger network to test!
- Running live at ISPs with 11 gbit/s of real customer performance and plenty of room to grow.

## New Architecture

- Rust-based back-end provides:
  - `lqosd` - a daemon that manages:
    - Loading/setup/unloading eBPF programs.
    - Gathers statistics directly from eBPF.
    - Provides a local "bus" for transporting data between components.
    - Sets "tunables", replacing the need for a separate offloading service.
  - `lqtop` - a console-based utility for viewing current activity.
  - `lqos_node_manager` - a web-based GUI that:
    - Monitors current activity.
    - Monitors system status.
    - Provides "best/worst" summaries of RTT.
    - Provides visibility into the working of queues.
    - Categorizes traffic to match your network hierarchy, letting you quickly find the bottlenecks.
    - Let's you browse and search your shaped devices.
    - Lists "unknown IP addresses" that are passing through the shaper but do not have a rule associated.
    - Allows you to view and edit the LibreQoS configuration.
  - `lqos_python` - provides Python access to the bus system.
  - `lqos_setup` - builds enough configuration files to get you started.
  - `lqos_users` - authentication for the GUIs.
- High-performance Python script:
  - Batches TC commands for fast execution.
  - Batches bus-transactions to associate IP subnets with users for fast execution.
  - Improved scheduler for InfluxDB graphing.

## High Performance Bridge (Bifrost)

- Optionally replace the Linux bridge system with an XDP-based bridge accelerator.
- Throughput is 30% higher in this mode.

## Packet and Flow Analysis (Heimdall)

- Viewing a circuit in the web UI displays a summary of IP traffic flows for that circuit.
- A "capture" button will capture packet headers, and allow nanosecond-level analysis of traffic data.
- You can download the packet captures in `libpcap` format, for analysis in Wireshark and similar tools.
- Configure the capture delay in `/etc/lqos.conf`

## Single-interface Mode

- Operate with a single network interface and VLANs for "in" and "out".

## Graphs

- Graph current throughput, shaped and unshaped.
- Graph CPU and RAM performance.
- Graph individual Cake shaper tins, backlog, delays.
- TCP "round trip time" histogram showing overall network latency performance.
- Per-network node traffic graph.
- Per-network node RTT latency histogram, to let you zero-in on troublespots.

## Miscellaneous

- `build_rust.sh` builds the entire package from a Git update, with minimal (<1 second) downtime.
- `build_dpkg.sh` assembles the entire system into an Ubuntu/Debian `.deb` installer.
- Sample `.service` files for `systemd` integration.
- Real-time adjustment to tunables.
- Redact text into Klingon to allow screenshots without sharing customer data.
- Preliminary support for reading IP data inside MPLS packets, as long as they are ordered "VLAN->MPLS->VPLS" and not the other way around.
- Automatically trim network trees that exceed 9 levels deep.
- Very accurate timing functions for better statistics.
- Greatly improved documentation.
- Improved rejection of TCP round-trip-time outliers (from long-polled connections).
- Improved Spylnx and UISP integrations.

## Better Distribution

> This is in alpha testing. It has worked on some test setups, but needs production testing.

Installation via `apt-get` and LibreQoS's own repo. Add the `libreqos` repo, and you can use `apt-get` to install/update the traffic shaper. This doesn't get you the development toolchain.

```sh
sudo echo "deb http://stats.libreqos.io/ubuntu jammy main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/libreqos.list
wget -O - -q http://stats.libreqos.io/repo.asc | apt-key add -
apt-get update
apt-get install libreqos
```

You will be asked some questions about your configuration, and the management daemon and webserver will automatically start. Go to `http://<your_ip>:9123/` to finish installation.
